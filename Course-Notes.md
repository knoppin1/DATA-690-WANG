# Python for Data Analysis Notes

## Chapter 1 

### *NumPy*
- Short for Numerical Python
- Provides the data structures, algorithms, and library glue needed for most scientific applications involving numerical data in Python
#### **Primary Features**
- A fast and efficient multidimensional array object ndarray
- Functions for performing element-wise computations with arrays or mathematical operations between arrays
- Tools for reading and writing array-based datasets to disk
- Linear algebra operations, Fourier transform, and random number generation
- A mature C API to enable Python extensions and native C or C++ code to access NumPyâ€™s data structures and computational facilities

### *pandas*
- Provides high-level data structures and functions designed to make working with structured or tabular data fast, easy, and expressive

#### **Primary Features**
- DataFrame: a tabular, column-oriented data structure with both row and column labels
- Series: a one-dimensional labeled array object
